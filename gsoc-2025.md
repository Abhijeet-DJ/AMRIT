# AMRIT - Google Summer of Code 2025 Ideas List

## 1. Video Consultation Module for AMRIT

### Description
Integrate an open-source video consultation solution (e.g., Jitsi) into AMRIT for Early Childhood Development (ECD) counselling. This will allow beneficiaries to opt for remote video consultations, improving engagement and diagnosis accuracy.

### Expected Outcomes
- Implement video consultation functionality within the existing call allocation system.
- Develop a scheduling and consent management system for video consultations.
- Enable ANMs and Medical Officers to initiate and manage video calls.
- Ensure fallback to regular audio calls for non-participating beneficiaries.

### Skills Required
- Angular (Frontend)
- Spring Boot (Backend)
- WebRTC / Jitsi / Open-source video conferencing tools
- API Integration

## 2. AI-Enhanced Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) for AMRIT

### Description
AMRIT currently has a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) that provides medical recommendations based on predefined rules. This project aims to enhance the CDSS using AI/ML models to improve decision-making, personalize recommendations, and align with updated health standards. The new system will be refactored into a standalone microservice for better scalability and maintainability.

### Expected Outcomes
- AI-powered enhancements for clinical decision-making, such as risk prediction and personalized recommendations.
- Integration of updated health guidelines and standards into the CDSS.
- Deployment as a microservice, improving system modularity and scalability.
- API endpoints for easy integration with existing AMRIT modules.
- Backward compatibility with existing services depending on CDSS.

### Skills Required/Preferred
- Java (Spring Boot)
- AI/ML fundamentals (preferably healthcare-focused models)
- RESTful API development
- Experience with FHIR or clinical data standards (preferred)
