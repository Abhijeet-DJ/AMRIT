# AMRIT

AMRIT (Accessible Medical Records via Integrated Technology) is an open-source digital electronic health record (EHR) platform developed by Piramal Swasthya Management and Research Institute (PSMRI) to advance accessible primary healthcare in India. This repository serves as the central hub for community tickets, discussions, and contributions, bringing together developers and healthcare enthusiasts to enhance and expand AMRITâ€™s capabilities. We invite the open-source community to collaborate with us in building scalable, interoperable healthcare solutions for a healthier future.
